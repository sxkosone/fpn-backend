# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# User.create(username: "wley", first_name: "Will", last_name: "Ley", password: "123wley")
# User.create(username: "susanna", first_name: "Susanna", last_name: "Kosonen", password: "password123")
